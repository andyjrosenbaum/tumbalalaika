Tumbalalaika music

Thoughts:

* v3 style is more dense and "crunchy", maybe good for choruses, especially final chorus
* might be good to mix it up with something a bit ligher for the earlier choruses
* for the verses, we want to be able to hear the solo, so something more open like new_v1 is better
* that's all for now
