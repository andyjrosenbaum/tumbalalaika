# Tumbalalaika music

## Thoughts:

* dense1 style is more "crunchy", maybe good for choruses, especially final chorus
* might be good to mix it up with something a bit ligher for the earlier choruses
* for the verses, we want to be able to hear the solo, so something more open like sparse1 is better
